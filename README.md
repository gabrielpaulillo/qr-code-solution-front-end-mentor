  - [Built with]
    - HTML5
    - CSS custom properties
  - [What I learned] 
    - I've learnt that I should pay more attention to the file's location, because I've created a CSS's paste outside of the project and it took me about 20 minutes to figure out why the CSS was not working, hahaha.
  - [Continued development]
    - This is just my first challenge, I am looking forward to the next one. I'm about to start learning about bootstrap, too.
